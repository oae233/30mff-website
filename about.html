    <p class="abt-par">“OM: Looking4Mother”, the first two letters of my name in english and also the phonetic transcription of the arabic word “أم” in my native egyptian dialect, is a short film born out of an explorative process that combines self-discovery and inquiry about the natural enviroment. In this film I combine captured visusal material to try and represent a journey of looking inwards, deconstructing my sense of self and identity. Building on Jungian ideas about the Feminine and Masculine being necessary and complementary parts of the psyche, I probe my own understanding of and my experiences with Femininity.
    Investigating the relationships between my real life mother, Egypt my “motherland”, and “mother nature”/nature as a system, I try to answer the question:
    <br>
    <br>
    What does my “Inner Feminine” look like, and where do all the parts that make it up come from?
